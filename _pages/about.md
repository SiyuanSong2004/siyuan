My name is Siyuan Song(宋思远). I am a 3rd-year Undergrad at [UT Linguistics](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/linguistics/). I am a member of [UT CompLing Group](https://sites.utexas.edu/compling/) and part of [UT NLP community](https://www.nlp.utexas.edu/). I'm fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Kyle Mahowald](https://mahowak.github.io/) and to work with a great team here. I worked as a Visiting Undergraduate Research Intern at [CoCoDev@Harvard](https://www.cocodev.org/) in the summer of 2024 mentored by Dr. [Jennifer Hu](https://jennhu.github.io/).

Before transferring to UT at 2024 Fall, I was an undergrd at [School of Foreign Languages@SJTU](https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/en/). 
There, I had the honor of develving into the field of Computational Linguistics under the guidance of Dr. [Hai Hu](https://huhailinguist.github.io/). I am happy to work with [SJTU CL Lab](https://huhailinguist.github.io/lab/) even after I left SJTU.

In general, my research aims to:

- use computational models to understand the underlying mechanism of language generalization and language transfer. 

- Study the role of context (i.e. visual hints, pragmatics) in language learning. 

- Evaluate language models in a scientific and cognitive-inspired way. 

- Build data efficient AI system that think and learn like human.

In my spare time, I make [music]({{ site.baseurl }}/music/), do/watch sports and cook.
