I am a singer/songwriter. My original songs are posted on [QQ Music](https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq/singer/001ZzRIg1thAgm) and [Netease Music](http://163cn.tv/yMZTE2T).

I am (was?) also a member of [SJTU Art Center](https://space.bilibili.com/200718111). In December 2023, as the music director, I, organized the original music gala, "Stories of Refractionï¼ˆæŠ˜å…‰è®°ï¼‰." [[Full Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yg4y1o7D1/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=0240d5bc56bdd79973526764b5688097)] [[MV](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cg4y1f7U1/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=0240d5bc56bdd79973526764b5688097)]

I acted as bassist(ðŸŽ¸with 4 strings and low pitch)/vocalðŸŽ¤/keyboardistðŸŽ¹ in a student band called ç¤« at SJTU. Some of our videos were posted [here](https://space.bilibili.com/399753707).

I led [Kairan](https://space.bilibili.com/488929786/), a non-profit music festival for high-school students in 2022.
