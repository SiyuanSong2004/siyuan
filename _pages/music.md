I am a singer/songwriter. My original songs are posted on QQ Music and Netease Music.

I am also a member of [SJTU Art Center](https://space.bilibili.com/200718111).

I also acted as bassist(ðŸŽ¸with 4 strings and low pitch)/vocalðŸŽ¤/keyboardistðŸŽ¹ in student bands at SJTU. Some of our videos were posted [here](https://space.bilibili.com/399753707).

I led [Kairan](https://space.bilibili.com/488929786/), a non-profit music festival for high-school students in 2022.
